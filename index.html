            <p> Aerial Shots combines both years of professional photographic experience with a love of technology to
                bring clients ultra high resolution aerial photography for a wide range of services. Our team can offer
                exclusive access to aerial photography that is hard to come by due to the complexities of U.S. airspace
                regulations. Thankfully we not only have the photography skill and tech ”know-how” but we also have a
                licensed and instrument reated pilot with a current UAS 107 on our team that enables us to guarantee
                legal and safe flights. We also have an FAA 107.29 waiver providing legal night time operation.</p>
